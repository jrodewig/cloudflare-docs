[Fauna](https://fauna.com/) is a distributed document-relational database that combines the flexibility of documents with the power of a relational, ACID compliant database that scales across regions, clouds or the globe.

## Set up an integration with Fauna

You need to have an existing Fauna database to connect to.

1. Open the [Fauna dashboard](https://dashboard.fauna.com/) in your browser and log in to your Fauna account.

   In the Fauna dashboard:

   1. Select **CREATE DATABASE**.
   2. Provide a valid name.
   3. Select a [Region Group](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/administration/region_groups).
   4. Select **CREATE**.

2. Create a new collection named **Products**. Enter the FQL query in the **SHELL** window on right side of the screen.

```js title="Create a new collection"
Collection.create({ name: "Products" });
```

3. Select **Run**. You will see an output similar to the following.

```js title="Output"
{
  name: "Products",
  coll: Collection,
  ts: "<timestamp>",
  indexes: {},
  constraints: []
}
```

4. Add the Fauna integration to your Worker:

   1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
   2. In **Account Home**, select **Workers & Pages**.
   3. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
   4. Select **Integrations** > **Fauna**.
   5. Follow the setup flow. Log in to your Fauna account and select the database created in step 1.

5. Install [the Fauna JavaScript driver](https://github.com/fauna/fauna-js) in your newly created Worker project.

```sh title="Install the Fauna driver"
npm install fauna
```

6. The following example shows how to make a query to your Fauna database in a Worker.

```js title="Query your Fauna database"
import { Client, fql } from "fauna";

export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		const client = new Client({
			secret: evn.DATABASE_KEY,
		});

		const result = await client.query(`Products.all()`);

		return new Response(JSON.stringify(result.data), {
			status: 200,
			headers: {
				"Content-Type": "application/json",
			},
		});
	},
};
```
